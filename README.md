## Mystique


Due to the dyanmic, almost shape-shifting, nature of [FatFractal's](http://www.fatfractal.com/) NoServer module and FFDL configuraiton importing existing data structures becomes *almost* a no brainer. There is no need to pre-define your schemea if you don't want, just set the [FFDL](http://fatfractal.com/prod/docs/reference/#ffdl) to **learn mode** and off you go.

### Name Genesis

> A fascinating aura of mystery, awe, and power surrounding someone or something.

> Mystique can psionically shift the atoms of her body to duplicate any humanoid of either sex, wearing any kind of clothing. She can precisely duplicate another person’s retina pattern, finger, palm and skin-pore patterns, and vocal cords. She can increase her volume, but not her mass. Mystique’s power grants her age retardation, increased healing, and immunity to drugs and poisons.
